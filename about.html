Hello! My name is Laksh Gupta. I am a software engineer by profession and spend my spare time on my pet projects. Areas of my interest are big data processing, artificial intelligence and data visualization. I also like to read and travel. I'll try to include pictures in this blog from the places I have visited.  
If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}">twitter</a>.
