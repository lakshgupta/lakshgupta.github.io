    "In the last post we saw a very simple approach to represent words in the vector form. Now we'll take a look at how we can generate word vectors using a neural network in an unsupervised manner. We are hoping that we'll learn the vector representation similar to as we learned the weight parameters for the [neural network](http://lakshgupta.github.io/2015/06/12/NeuralNetwork/), and at end of the process we'll have something which will capture the syntactic or semantic relationship between the words better than what we got by creating the co-occurance matrix."
