<span class="caption text-muted">A Biological Neuron</span></center><p>More information about a biological neuron can be found on <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron>Wikipedia</a>.</p><h2 class=section-heading>Artificial Neuron</h2>An artificial neuron is a mathematical model of a biological neuron. The steps mentined for a biological neuron can be mapped to an artificial neuron as:<ul><li>an artificial neuron receives the input as numerical values rather than the electrical signals. Input can come from different sources such as an image or a text.</li><li>it then multiplies each of the input value by a value called the weight.</li><li>weighted sum is calculated then to represent the total strength of the input signal, and an activation function is applied on the sum to get the output. This output can be sent further to other artificial neurons.</li></ul><blockquote>The artificial neuron receives one or more inputs (representing dendrites) and sums them to produce an output (representing a neuron's axon). Usually the sums of each node are weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions. They are also often monotonically increasing, continuous, differentiable and bounded.<p align=right>- <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron>Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote><p>Considering only a single input vector x:</p><center><canvas id=artificialneuron width=500 heigth=400></canvas></center><ul><li>$$f(x,w) = \phi(\sum\limits_{i=0}^n(w_i x_i)) = \phi(w^Tx)$$  </li><li>$$\phi$$ is our activation function.</li><li>$$x_i$$ are the elements of the input vector x.</li><li>$$w_i$$ are the elements of the weight vector w.</li><li>$$y$$ is the output.</li></ul><p>Notice that in terms of &ldquo;learning&rdquo; in almost all of the machine learning algorithms, we learn the weight parameters $$w_i$$.</p><h2 class=section-heading>Activation Function</h2>An artificial neuron using a step activation function is known as a Perceptron. Perceptron can act as a binary classifier based on if the value of the activation function is above or below a threashold. But step activation function may not be a good choice every time.<blockquote>In fact, a small change in the weights or bias of any single perceptron in the network can sometimes cause the output of that perceptron to completely flip, say from 0 to 1. That flip may then cause the behaviour of the rest of the network to completely change in some very complicated way. So while your "9" might now be classified correctly, the behaviour of the network on all the other images is likely to have completely changed in some hard-to-control way. That makes it difficult to see how to gradually modify the weights and biases so that the network gets closer to the desired behaviour.<p align=right>- <a href=http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html>Michael Nielsen</a></p></blockquote><p>There are other activation functions which seem to work generally better in most of the cases, such as tanh or maxout functions.</p><blockquote>"What neuron type should I use?" Use the ReLU non-linearity, be careful with your learning rates and possibly monitor the fraction of "dead" units in a network. If this concerns you, give Leaky ReLU or Maxout a try. Never use sigmoid. Try tanh, but expect it to work worse than ReLU/Maxout.<p align=right>- <a href=http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/>Andrej Karpathy</a></p></blockquote><center><canvas id=step width=200 height=200></canvas>
