Recurrent neural network is good in handling sequential data because they have a memory component which enables this network to remember past (few) information making it better for a model requiring varying length inputs and outputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, consider the two sentences “I went to Nepal in 2009” and “In 2009,I went to Nepal.” If we ask a machine learning model to read each sentence and extract the year in which the narrator went to Nepal, we would like it to recognize the year 2009 as the relevant piece of information, whether it appears in the sixth word or the second word of the sentence. Suppose that we trained a feedforward network that processes sentences of ﬁxed length. A traditional fully connected feedforward network would have separate parameters for each input feature, so itwould need to learn all of the rules of the language separately at each position in the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
